# 📝 Technical Report Mastery

## 1. Core Philosophy (The "Why")
Communication is the final stage of engineering. A feature isn't finished until its impact is documented and understood by both engineers (Technical) and stakeholders (Executive).

## 2. Capabilities & Rules (The "What")

### Rule 1: The Unified Standard Mandate (ANTI-NGIDE)
- **NO DEVIATION**: Every report MUST adhere to the [TECHNICAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md](/home/puterakahfi/.agent/memory/global/TECHNICAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md).
- **TEMPLATE LOCK**: Do not "innovate" or change the section titles. Use the standardized headers (Executive Brief, Technical Implementation, etc.).
- **NO PERSONAS**: Reports must be authored using professional names (e.g., "Putera Kahfi"), never "Antigravity Oracle" or "Sovereign Soul".

### Rule 2: Multi-Perspective Reporting
Every major delivery MUST have three levels of documentation (as sections in the unified report):
1.  **Executive Brief**: High-level value and status (For PM/CEO).
2.  **Technical Implementation**: Technical deep-dive and code changes (For Devs).
3.  **Security & Impact**: OWASP mapping and performance (For QA/Security).

### Rule 3: Visual & Structural Excellence
- Use tables for metadata and test results.
- Use code blocks for evidence (tests/logs).

## 3. Usage Instructions (The "How")

### 3.1 Generating a Report
1.  **Read Standard**: Load `/home/puterakahfi/.agent/memory/global/TECHNICAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md`.
2.  **Draft**: Fill the sections with evidence collected during task execution.
3.  **Export**: Use the Sovereign Neural CLI `npm run sov document:export` for the final PDF.

## 4. Maintenance
- **Review**: Does the report answer "What, Why, and Proof"?
- **Audit**: Verify isolation of artifact folders.
