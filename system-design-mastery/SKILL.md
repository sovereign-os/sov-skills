# 🌐 System Design Mastery

## 1. Scalability
Horizontal vs Vertical scaling. Load balancing and state management.

## 2. Communication Protocols

## 3. Reliability
Error handling, retries, circuit breakers, and idempotency.

## 4. Modeling
Ensure system components are decoupled and follow the Single Source of Truth principle.
