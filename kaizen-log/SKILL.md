# 📈 Kaizen Log

## 1. Core Philosophy (The "Why")

"Kaizen" means change for the better. This skill ensures that the Sovereign OS Agent never makes the same mistake twice. It is the tactical memory of the system that captures wisdom from failures and standardizes successes.

## 2. When to use this skill

This skill is activated when the task requires Continuous improvement protocol for personal growth, knowledge compounding, and strict codebase hygiene..

- Detected when the user's intent matches the semantic domain of 📈 Kaizen Log.
- Triggered by technical requirements or explicit architectural requests.

## 3. How to use it

### The "Law of Non-Repetition"

1. **Error Capture**: Every time a command fails or a user corrects a visual/logical error (e.g., "typography too condensed"), it MUST be logged.
2. **Wisdom Distillation**: Identify the root cause (instruction ambiguity, tool limitation, or agent assumption).
3. **Standardization**: Create a "Prevention Rule" within this log to be checked before future tasks.

### Knowledge Shards

- **Visuals**: No condensed tracking for headers (Fixed: 2026-01-28).
- **Paths**: Use absolute paths for all `view_file` calls to avoid directory ambiguity.
- **Registry Over Discovery**: Never run `ls` or `find` to discover infrastructure (Docker containers, paths, ports) if `registry/projects/` contains the manifest. (Added: 2026-02-11).
- **Workflow**: Always check `package.json` scripts before guessing `npm run` commands.

### Usage Instructions

- During `/refactor-sweep`, check the `kaizen-log` for pending hygiene tasks.
- When starting a task, read the most recent entries to avoid known pitfalls.
