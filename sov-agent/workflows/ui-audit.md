This workflow triggers the full spectrum of Sovereign OS design skills to audit, refine, and engineer premium user interfaces.

## 🛠️ Engaged Skills

- `ui-ux-mastery`: For core UX principles and psychological hierarchy.
- `design-system-mastery`: For token-based consistency and thematic purity.
- `typography-mastery`: For authoritative font scaling and rhythmic hierarchy.
- `atomic-design-mastery`: For modular and scalable component architecture.
- `high-fidelity-motion-design`: For tactile feedback and smooth micro-interactions.
- `responsive-design-mastery`: For multi-device fluidity and adaptive layouts.
- `ui-ux-patterns-mastery`: To ensure industry-standard interaction models.

## 🔄 Sequence

1.  **Visual Hierarchy Audit (The 3-Second Rule)**:
    - Identify the primary, secondary, and tertiary calls to action.
    - Audit color contrast and focus points using `ui-ux-mastery`.

2.  **Typography & Rhythm Sweep**:
    - Apply `typography-mastery` to align font scales to the Golden Ratio.
    - Calibrate letter-spacing and line-heights for maximum "luxury" appeal.

3.  **Token Validation**:
    - Ensure every color and spacing value maps to a token in `design-system-mastery`.
    - Eliminate any "hardcoded" values in the CSS/Tailwind layers.

4.  **Motion & Tactile Layer**:
    - Add meaningful micro-interactions (hover, transitions, feedback) using `high-fidelity-motion-design`.
    - Ensure animations are performance-optimized and purposeful.

5.  **Multi-Device Stress Test**:
    - Audit the layout across Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop using `responsive-design-mastery`.
    - Ensure hit-target sizes are finger-friendly for touch devices.
